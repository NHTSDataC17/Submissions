### Average Weighted Trips per Household by Census Divisions

The average trips per household by division were calculated to identify commute trends; as a result, the household table was sorted for census divisions as follows:

1. Selected census divisions with the 5 highest total of weighted households per the NHTS codebook.
2. Divisions were further sorted by ones with and without subway system.
3. The households identified in these divisions were then matched with trips.
4. The weighted trip values within each division were totaled, then divided by total households.
5. Result was average weighted trips per household by division.

The divisions identified with highest total weight households were as follows:

1. Mid-Atlantic > 1M with Subway
2. Mid-Atlantic > 1M w/o Subway
3. East North Central > 1M with Subway
4. East North Central > 1M w/o Subway
5. South Atlantic > 1M with Subway
6. South Atlantic > 1M w/o Subway
7. East South Central > 1M with Subway
8. East South Central > 1M w/o Subway
9. Pacific > 1M with Subway
10. Pacific > 1M w/o Subway

The results were plotted in the chart below with the following observations:

1. Trip Count: Total trip count was higher in all divisions with access to a subway system than those without access. This trend implies that households with access to a subway system tend to be more densely populated and result in higher trip count.
2. Trip Count Distribution: Trip count were distributed evenly between divisions despite household count differences which may be due to weight ranking or household formation (larger or smaller size).
